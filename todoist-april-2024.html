An incredibly simple way to get unstuck.

If you‚Äôre a long-time subscriber, you may recognize me as one of the former authors of this newsletter. Naomi is out of office and asked if I‚Äôd be interested in doing a guest reappearance for April.

The idea sounded great‚Ä¶in the abstract. Of course, as soon as I sat down to actually write the darn thing, I was stricken with a severe case of overthinking, analysis paralysis, and have-I-ever-managed-to-string-together-a-coherent-sentence-in-my-life-itis.

Then I stopped to ask myself the question Tim Ferriss uses whenever he‚Äôs stressed and overwhelmed ‚Äì what would this look like if it were easy? (https://x.com/tferriss/status/1716441791195423084?s=20) ‚Äì and decided to resurface one of my favorite issues from our newsletter archives instead.

For the ~80,000 of you who‚Äôve joined the newsletter since I first wrote about the JOT Method, I hope you enjoy it. For those of you who‚Äôve read it before, please forgive my laziness and maybe consider a re-read. Or just skip to the end for some Todoist news and a new video guide from Naomi (it‚Äôs one you definitely do not want to miss).

Until next time,

** The ‚ÄúJust One Thing‚Äù Method
------------------------------------------------------------

I received this question from a reader a few months ago and I'm finally getting around to answering it (the irony isn't lost on me):

I always like the blogs you guys do, but I feel like they're often aimed at people who have their s#%t together a bit more than the average person hoping and wishing for more productive work days. But there are people who are really struggling. Do you guys write blogs to help those people, too?

There are people out there ‚Äî I'm sometimes one of them ‚Äî who can't even manage a single task in their eight hours at work. There's anxiety and fear built into doing things or planning them out. There's depression and burnout and overwhelm getting in the way of their own success. There are people grappling with ADHD as well.


Thoughts?


Thanks,

Nathan*


P.S. I'm writing you this note instead of working on the thing I'm supposed to be doing. Very classic Nathan on display here. FML.

Nathan's question has stuck with me because, frankly, sometimes I'm one of those people too. The thing about "getting your s#%t together" is that you think it's going to be a one-time event: I do not have my s#%t together. ‚Üí I will learn the secret of getting my s#%t together. ‚Üí I will then have my s#%t together henceforth and forevermore.

Unfortunately, that's...not how it works. At least in my experience.

There are times when I feel like I have everything figured out: I'm doing my weekly reviews, planning my time and energy around my priorities, and getting to #TodoistZero by 5pm every day. I feel invincible.

And there are times when everything feels like it's falling apart. My to-do list is overwhelming, so, naturally, I ignore it. Instead of doing deep work on my most important task first thing in the morning, I check Twitter. Like Nathan, I sometimes end an eight-hour workday without having accomplished anything of significance and yet somehow still feel exhausted.

(Heck, I can ricochet between those two feelings multiples times a week.)

Telling someone who already feels overwhelmed and paralyzed how to create a system for organizing their lives is like giving a drowning person the blueprint for building a boat. Not super helpful.**

The systems, advice, and tools that you need when you're at the helm of the ship headed for the horizon aren't necessarily the ones you need when you've fallen overboard and are barely keeping your head above water. At that point, you don't need a map, a compass, or a better ship ‚Äî you need a lifesaver. Enter the advice of David Parker from his book The More You Do, The Better You Feel (https://www.amazon.com/More-You-Better-Feel-Procrastination/dp/1935880012) .

Now an author and speaker on the subject of mental health and procrastination, Parker struggled with anxiety and depression for years. On the advice of a friend, he started keeping a feelings journal. Over time, he began noticing a connection between the tasks he was putting off and his feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.

Unsurprisingly, the worse he felt, the more he procrastinated. But the relationship actually felt stronger in reverse: The more he procrastinated the worse he felt. Armed with that insight, he devised a method for trading his procrastinating habit with a doing habit. He called his system the Just One Thing or J.O.T. Method.

Here's how it works:
1. Take a pen or pencil and turn to a blank page of a notebook.
2. Write today's date in the upper left-hand corner.
3. Think of one simple task that you've been putting off. Write it down underneath the date.
4. Do that task and only that task. Don't write out a to-do list. It's easy to let yourself get distracted by all of the other undone tasks you aren't doing. Just do the one thing you wrote down.
5. Once it's done, draw a thin line through the task so that you can still read it, but you know it's complete.
6. Repeat steps 3-5.

At the end of the day, you'll end up with a list that looks like this:

The goal of J.O.T. isn't to get more stuff done. Or even to get more of the "right" stuff done. Instead, the aim is to break the procrastination-paralysis loop right now by proving to yourself that you are, in fact, capable of following through and taking action. As the title of the book states, the more you do, the better you'll feel.

And the better you feel, the more you'll feel capable of taking on.

At some point, you may even find yourself safe and dry back on deck, in the right headspace to set goals, organize and prioritize your Todoist tasks, conduct weekly reviews, plan out your days the night before, GTD, time block, and all the other productivity best practices out there. If (when) you start to feel yourself slipping, don't panic. Simply come back to focus on Just One Thing.

Remember that no matter how overwhelmed and paralyzed you feel, you're always one small action away from being back on the right track.***

** This month in video: Getting Things Done ‚úÖ
------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ0KNifv5PU

It‚Äôs the one we‚Äôve all been waiting for! Naomi is wrapping up her tour of productivity methods with what is arguably the most popular one of all time and a favorite among Todoisters: Getting Things Done (or GTD for short) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ0KNifv5PU) .

There‚Äôs a reason that GTD has gained a cult-like following in the two decades since David Allen first developed it. Even if you don‚Äôt adopt the system wholesale, you‚Äôre guaranteed to come away with a nugget or two that will change the way you think about, well, getting things done.
